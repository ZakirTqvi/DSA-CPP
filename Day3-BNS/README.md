## âœ… Topics Covered

### 1. What is Number System?

A **Number System** is a way to represent numbers using digits or symbols in a consistent manner. The most commonly used number systems include:
- **Decimal Number System (Base-10)**
- **Binary Number System (Base-2)**
- **Octal Number System (Base-8)**
- **Hexadecimal Number System (Base-16)**

---

### 2. What is Decimal Number System?

The **Decimal Number System** is a **base-10** system that uses **10 digits (0 to 9)**. It is the standard number system used in everyday life.

Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10.

**Example**:  
`253 = (2 Ã— 100) + (5 Ã— 10) + (3 Ã— 1)`

---

### 3. What is Binary Number System?

The **Binary Number System** is a **base-2** system that uses only **two digits (0 and 1)**. It is the fundamental language of computers and digital electronics.

Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2.

**Example**:  
`1011 = (1 Ã— 8) + (0 Ã— 4) + (1 Ã— 2) + (1 Ã— 1) = 11 (Decimal)`
